# conman-e621
New old tagging client for NSFW imageboard e621.

In pre-alpha with zero commits for years now. I'm a bad programmer, so this project will probably never be finished.

Long term goal: Make it so I can quickly switch between images in a search (using keyboard shortcuts) and apply one of a set of tags e.g. s for solo, d for duo, g for group, n to add to the tag-later set.
